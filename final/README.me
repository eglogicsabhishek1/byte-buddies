Medical Website with Statistical Model Integration
Overview
This is a comprehensive medical website designed to offer users an interactive, informative, and user-friendly platform for healthcare information. The website integrates a statistical model to provide personalized medical insights, recommendations, and predictions based on the user's input.

The website consists of the following pages:

Homepage: Introduction to the website and features.
Contact: Contact form for inquiries and support.
About: Information about the medical website and its mission.
Prescription List: A dedicated page for managing and displaying a list of prescribed medicines via the admin panel.
Chatbot: A page dedicated to interacting with the chatbot.
The core of the website utilizes a statistical model that processes user data (e.g., health symptoms, personal information) to provide recommendations, risk assessments, or insights into various medical conditions.

Additionally, the website includes a chatbot feature that interacts with users, offering assistance and guiding them through the available services.

Features
1. Homepage
Welcoming interface with a brief overview of the website’s purpose.
Introduction to the model’s capabilities, such as predicting health risks, offering lifestyle advice, and more.
Chatbot Popup: A chatbot popup feature is available on the homepage. Though the popup template has been created, it is currently not functional. The chatbot will be integrated to assist users with medical queries in future versions.
Quick links to access the About, Contact, Prescription List, and Chatbot pages.
2. Contact
A contact form to reach out for inquiries or technical support.
Integration of email functionality for users to receive responses directly.
3. About
Details about the website's development, purpose, and how the statistical model works.
Overview of the team or organization behind the website.
The mission of offering reliable medical insights using data-driven methods.
4. Prescription List
A page where administrators can manage and display prescribed medicines. Admins can add, modify, and delete medicines from the prescription list directly through the admin panel.
Admin Panel Access: The admin panel is accessible using the credentials:
Username: admin
Password: 1234
The prescription data is linked to the backend and can be updated directly from the Django admin interface.
5. Chatbot Page
Dedicated Chatbot Interaction: A separate page dedicated to chatbot interactions where users can ask questions and receive answers.
Current Status: The chatbot's core functionality has been designed and is being integrated for future use. The page is available, but full interaction features are still being developed.
Popup Template: The chatbot popup template exists on the homepage, and it will be activated in future updates for more convenient access.
6. Statistical Model
The model uses real-time input from users (e.g., health data, symptoms, or risk factors) to generate statistical predictions.
Implements common statistical methods such as regression analysis, classification models, or clustering to assess risk factors for common medical conditions.
Data privacy and security measures are in place to protect sensitive health information.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React for dynamic elements).
Backend: Python (Django for web framework, managing user input and chatbot logic).
Statistical Modeling: SciPy, Scikit-learn, or TensorFlow (depending on the model’s complexity).
Database: SQLite or MySQL for storing user inputs, prescription data, and more.
How It Works
User Input: The user provides relevant health data via forms (such as age, symptoms, medical history, etc.).
Data Processing: The input data is sent to the backend where the statistical model processes it.
Model Analysis: The model runs predictions and generates insights based on trained algorithms and statistical methods.
Results: The website returns recommendations, risk assessments, or predictions, which the user can review.
Prescription Management (Admin Panel)
To manage prescriptions, the admin panel allows authorized users (like the admin) to access and modify the prescription list. You can manage medicines, update their details, or delete entries.

How to access:
Visit the Django admin page at http://localhost:8000/admin.
Log in using:
Username: admin
Password: 1234
Navigate to the Prescription List section to manage the data.
Data Privacy and Security
We understand the importance of keeping your medical information private. The website employs:

Encryption to secure sensitive data during transmission.
Strict data privacy policies to ensure user data is only used for model predictions and is not shared without consent.
